# CYCLUS2FCO

This provides a small c/c++ tool which allows to generated the FCO_Output.txt. 
The temp_Sheet.xlsm contain a macro (pullData) which will get the data stored in FCO_Output.txt and send it to the Output.xlsm excel file.

This tool actually only works with the CYCLUS simulation :EG01-EG23 you can find on : https://github.com/Baaaaam/EG01-EG23/tree/2015_LWR-group-SEP_SFR-Dedi-SEP_DU_RU_Storage.
